# Museum Escape Room
This is an interactive game for visitors to play whilst visiting the American Musuem and Gardens. It is a web game built using Construct3 and hosted at their museum to add a gamified element to their permanent exhibition. Titled 'Rebellion In Progress' the digital escape room tells the story of finding Daniel Shays' Rebellion plan in order to allow Shays's Rebellion 1786 - 1787 against massachusetts new tax laws to go ahead. 

This was made as part of my final year dissertation "Investigating Digital Escape Rooms to Increase Musuem Engagement for Young Adults"
